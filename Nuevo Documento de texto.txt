Since you're working on a memory card game and have various components in place (like Login, Difficulty, Categories, etc.), the best approach is to prioritize the functionality of these individual pages so that the user experience is smooth and logical. Here's a suggestion for the order of development:

1. Play Game (/play):
Reason: This is the most important part of your app—the game itself. Once you have the game working, you’ll have a solid foundation for the rest of the features. You can integrate the necessary functionality of the memory game, ensure that it's playable, and tweak it as needed.

What to do: Ensure that the game logic is set up, like the board layout, card matching, win/lose conditions, and scoring.

2. Difficulty (/difficulty):
Reason: The difficulty selector can control the number of cards or how fast the cards flip, which directly affects the gameplay experience. It’s essential for the user to be able to set difficulty before playing the game.

What to do: Create a simple form where users can select difficulty (e.g., Easy, Medium, Hard), and pass the selected difficulty to the memory game.

3. Categories (/categories):
Reason: Categories allow players to choose the type of cards they want to play with. It can be a fun way to personalize the game experience (e.g., animals, movies, sports).

What to do: Allow the user to pick from various categories, and once selected, display the respective images for the game.

4. Score (/score):
Reason: It’s essential for users to view their scores after each game. You can pull the scores from local storage or a backend like Firebase, and display them with options to reset, view historical scores, etc.

What to do: Create a scoreboard that displays previous scores and allows users to see their progress over time.

5. Language (/language):
Reason: Language selection can enhance the user experience for a broader audience, especially if your game will support multiple languages. This can be added after the game is functional.

What to do: Allow the user to select their preferred language, and display the game and interface text accordingly. You can use i18n libraries to help with localization.

6. Credits (/credits):
Reason: Credits typically don’t affect gameplay, so you can add this last. It’s just a page to thank anyone who contributed, list libraries used, etc.

What to do: Create a simple credits page listing contributors and any libraries or tools you used to build the app.

7. Login (/login):
Reason: You can implement a login page later, especially if you plan to have user accounts or a score system that persists across sessions. This can be tied to a backend (e.g., Firebase Authentication) to store user data, scores, etc.

What to do: If you're implementing user login, connect it to a system like Firebase for authentication. Initially, you could skip this and focus on the gameplay.

Suggested Workflow:
First: Focus on getting the MemoryGame component and logic working.

Second: Add difficulty selection (/difficulty) and categories (/categories).

Third: Implement a basic score tracking system (/score).

Fourth: Work on language switching (/language).

Fifth: Add credits and about page (/credits).

Finally: Add user authentication (if needed) for login functionality (/login).

By building the game first and ensuring the core experience is there, you'll have a working app before adding the bells and whistles like login or localization.
